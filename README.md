Learning OS concepts by projects

1. Process Scheduler Simulation:
    - Start with process scheduling, as it introduces the fundamental concepts of processes, process states, and CPU scheduling algorithms.
    - Implement different scheduling algorithms like Round Robin, First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), and Priority Scheduling.
    - Understand how processes are managed and scheduled by the operating system.

2. Memory Management Simulation:
    * Move on to memory management, which deals with allocating and managing memory resources for processes.
    * Implement memory allocation techniques like contiguous allocation, paging, and segmentation.
    * Understand how the operating system handles memory allocation and addresses issues like fragmentation and efficient utilization.
    
3. Inter-Process Communication (IPC) Mechanisms:
    * Explore inter-process communication mechanisms, which enable processes to exchange data and synchronize their activities.
    * Implement IPC mechanisms like pipes, message queues, shared memory, and semaphores.
    * Understand how processes can communicate and coordinate their actions in a multi-process environment.
    
4. Thread Synchronization:
    * Dive into thread synchronization, which is essential for managing shared resources in a multi-threaded environment.
    * Implement synchronization primitives like mutexes, semaphores, and condition variables.
    * Understand how threads can synchronize and coordinate access to shared data to prevent race conditions and ensure data consistency.
    
5. File System Implementation:
    * Explore file systems, which provide a structured way to store and manage data on storage devices.
    * Implement a basic file system that supports operations like creating, reading, writing, and deleting files and directories.
    * Understand how file systems organize and manage data, and how the operating system interacts with the file system.
    
6. Virtual Memory Manager:
    * Move on to virtual memory management, which allows efficient utilization of memory resources and enables running large programs.
    * Implement a virtual memory manager that simulates page table management, address translation, and page replacement algorithms.
    * Understand how virtual memory works, how it is managed by the operating system, and how it enhances memory utilization.
    
7. Shell Implementation:
    * Explore the concept of a shell, which provides a user interface to interact with the operating system.
    * Build a basic shell that supports command execution, input/output redirection, and pipe functionality.
    * Understand how the shell interprets user commands, executes programs, and manages input/output streams.
  
8. Device Driver Simulation:
    * Finally, delve into device drivers, which facilitate communication between the operating system and hardware devices.
    * Create a simulated device driver that interacts with a virtual hardware device and handles interrupts, I/O operations, and resource management.
    * Understand how device drivers work, how they abstract hardware details, and how they enable the operating system to communicate with devices.
